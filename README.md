These are my attempts at solving the 2018 version of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

It's a bit of a late start for me, but hey, it's still fun.

I've decided to use [NodeJs](https://Nodejs.org) with [Express](https://expressjs.com). I've stuck with using JavaScript (ECMA Script 6) instead of TypeScript. For now. I'll update this later on when the code might be a bit more complex.

The solutions are not all the most efficient way of solving the problem. I do try to keep [Big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) in mind. Some refactoring might occur later.
